  MDT - MOVE TIP, DETECT LIQUID, SUBMERGE:

TipSelect, Submerge, Z-start, Z-max, Z-add1...Z-add8
MOVE TIP, DETECT LIQUID, SUBMERGE:
The MDT command moves the selected tips to Z-start and then searches downward until it detects liquid or reaches Z-max. If no liquid is detected the tips will move back to their Z-travel position and an error code will be generated. If liquid is detected, the tips will be lowered by the specified Submerge distance and verify that another Add distance can be lowered before reaching Z-max. If this is not possible, an error code is generated. If the parameter TipSelect is not defined, all possible tips are used to detect liquid. If the parameters Submerge, Z-start or Z-max are not defined, the MDT command is using the individual position values. Those values can be set for each axis separately by the following commands: SBL (set submerge distance), STL (set Z-start position) ,SML (set Z-max position) and SDL (set save detection retract distance). The MDT command can handle also different detection procedures and modes which can be set by the SDM (set detection mode) command. The number of Z-add parameter depends on the number of installed tips.
TipSelect:        binary decoded tip select [0...255]
Submerge:        distance in 0.1 mm  [0...Z-range set by SRA cmd]
Z-start:        distance in 0.1 mm  [0...Z-range set by SRA cmd]          
Z-max:        distance in 0.1 mm  [0...Z-range set by SRA cmd]
Addi:                distance in 0.1 mm. Required distance to travel downwards before reaching Z-                        Max. 
EXAMPLE: #A1MDT170,20,1000,600
Move tip 2, 4, 6 & 8 down to Z-start height (100 mm), then start liquid detection until Z-max          
           (60 mm) is reached. If Liquid is detected, submerge with 0.2 mm.
